This is the repository for the diffusion limited discriminator (DLD) code. It is intended as a engineering-level code for the evaluation of hypersonic finite-rate gas surface interaction (GSI) models. This code takes in free stream conditions and a user-defined finite rate reaction set (default is air carbon ablation model by Prata et al.\[cite\]) and determines if the GSI chemistry is in a diffusion-limited or a rate-limited reigieme with an estimated Dahmk\"oler number.
